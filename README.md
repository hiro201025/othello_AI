## othello_AI
  
  
1. Code Language and library
  - coding by python
  - machine learning using pytorch
  
  
2. Contents
  - surprising learning policy network (SLpn), reinforcement learning (RLpn) by DQN, Value network and MonteCarlo tree search (MCTS)
  - othello enviroment made by self
  
  
3. Description of the models
  - othello AI refer to Alpha Go 
  - these code refer to many web sites.
  - SLpn: learning policy network by 6 millions othello states in online
  - RLpn: learning policy network by DQN using SLpn parameters
  - learning Value network by RLpn playing data
  - making MonteCarlo tree search to search deeper and faster

4. How strong is this model?
  - MCTS is as strong as SLpn.
  - MCTS is not strong because of RLpn is not good
